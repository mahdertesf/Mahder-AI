Introduction  \n","\n","In this notebook, I will pretrain a Transformer network on an Amharic dataset collected from a variety of Telegram channels, using the Masked Language Model (MLM). The primary objective of pretraining is to enable the model to learn contextualized word and phrase representations, thereby enhancing its understanding of language semantics. The Transformer’s self-attention mechanism plays a crucial role by allowing the model to dynamically weigh different parts of the input sequence, effectively capturing long-range dependencies in the data.  \n","\n","After pretraining, I will fine-tune the model on a labeled dataset of hate speech and deploy the resulting model in the **Mahder AI** app.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":24196,"status":"ok","timestamp":1740034354931,"user":{"displayName":"Mahder Tesfaye","userId":"17772783101485914098"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"e0ctKNwS7hc4","outputId":"fbcb22e9-8f96-4a8c-f59e-b1b3e728b5ac"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["# prompt: import drive\n","\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wE_KPXem7acG"},"source":["\n","## 2.

Next, We Will Train the Tokenizer\n","\n","Tokenization is a critical step in natural language processing (NLP) as it converts raw text into smaller, meaningful units (tokens) that can be processed by machine learning models. Effective tokenization ensures that the model can understand and interpret the text accurately, which is essential for tasks like text classification, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.\n","\n","For this task, we will use the **SentencePiece tokenizer** instead of traditional word-based tokenization. The [SentencePieceTokenizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/api_docs/python/text/SentencepieceTokenizer) is a powerful tool that tokenizes text into **subword units**, which offers several advantages:\n","\n","1. **Handling Complex Word Structures**: SentencePiece breaks words into smaller subword units, making it effective for handling complex word structures and morphological variations, which are common in languages like Amharic.\n","2. **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words**: By using subword tokenization, SentencePiece can handle out-of-vocabulary words more gracefully, as it can decompose them into known subword units.\n","3. **Multilingual Support**: SentencePiece is language-agnostic, making it suitable for multilingual datasets. This is particularly useful for Amharic, as it can handle the repetition of common subwords and morphological patterns unique to the language.\n","4. **Simplified Preprocessing**: SentencePiece works directly on raw text, eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing steps like word segmentation or stemming.\n","5. **Seamless Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, ensuring consistent tokenization across training and inference pipelines.\n","\n","Given these benefits, SentencePiece is an ideal choice for tokenizing Amharic text, as it can effectively capture the language's unique characteristics while simplifying the overall preprocessing workflow."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UvDyWgWT7acK"},"source":["Let's train sentencepiece tokenizer model first. in order to do that we need to save our cleaned data into a single corpus of text in .txt file"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DAdrNZ-j7acK"},"outputs":[],"source":["#with open(\"datas/cleaned_data.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n","  #  for content in cleaned_data:\n","   #     file.write(content + \"\\n\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"1gQ3i7Ra7acK","outputId":"0f121046-23e3-48a7-bce4-e41477674e3c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Training SentencePiece model...\n","Training complete!

The following function creates positional encoding given the embedding vectors.\n","\n","In sequence-to-sequence tasks, the relative order of your data is extremely important to its meaning. When you were training sequential neural networks such as RNNs, you fed your inputs into the network in order. Information about the order of your data was automatically fed into your model. However, when you train a Transformer network using multi-head attention, you feed your data into the model all at once. While this dramatically reduces training time, there is no information about the order of your data. This is where positional encoding is useful - you can specifically encode the positions of your inputs and pass them into the network using these sine and cosine formulas:\n","\n","$$\n","PE_{(pos, 2i)}= sin\\left(\\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\\frac{2i}{d}}}\\right)\n","$$\n","\n","$$\n","PE_{(pos, 2i+1)}= cos\\left(\\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\\frac{2i}{d}}}\\right)\n","$$\n","\n","Where:\n","\n","*   `d` is the dimension of the word embedding and positional encoding.\n","*   `pos` is the position of the word.\n","*   `i` refers to each of the different dimensions in the positional encodings, where `i = k // 2`.\n","\n","To develop some intuition about positional encodings, you can think of them broadly as a feature that contains the information about the relative positions of words. The sum of the positional encoding and word embedding is ultimately what is fed into the model.  If you just hard code the positions in, say by adding a matrix of 1's or whole numbers to the word embedding, the semantic meaning is distorted. Conversely, the values of the sine and cosine equations are small enough (between -1 and 1) that when you add the positional encoding to a word embedding, the word embedding is not significantly distorted, and is instead enriched with positional information. Using a combination of these two equations helps your Transformer network attend to the relative positions of your input data.\n","\n","### Sine and Cosine Angles\n","\n","Notice that even though the sine and cosine positional encoding equations take in different arguments (`2i` versus `2i+1`, or even versus odd numbers) the inner terms for both equations are the same:\n","\n","$$\\theta(pos, i, d) = \\frac{pos}{10000^{\\frac{2i}{d}}}$$\n","\n","Consider the inner term as you calculate the positional encoding for a word in a sequence:\n","\n","$PE_{(pos, 0)}= sin\\left(\\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\\frac{0}{d}}}\\right)$, since solving `2i = 0` gives `i = 0`\n","\n","$PE_{(pos, 1)}= cos\\left(\\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\\frac{0}{d}}}\\right)$, since solving `2i + 1 = 1` gives `i = 0`\n","\n","The angle is the same for both! The angles for $PE_{(pos, 2)}$ and $PE_{(pos, 3)}$ are the same as well, since for both, `i = 1` and therefore the inner term is $\\left(\\frac{pos}{{10000}^{\\frac{2}{d}}}\\right)$.

You will need to define a boolean mask that specifies to which elements you must attend (1) and which elements you must ignore (0) and you do this by looking at all the zeros in the sequence.
