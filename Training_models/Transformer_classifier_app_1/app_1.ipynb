    "## 1. Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will pretrain a Transformer network on an Amharic dataset collected from a variety of Telegram channels, using the Masked Language Model (MLM). The primary objective of pretraining is to enable the model to learn contextualized word and phrase representations, thereby enhancing its understanding of language semantics. The Transformerâ€™s self-attention mechanism plays a crucial role by allowing the model to dynamically weigh different parts of the input sequence, effectively capturing long-range dependencies in the data.  \n",

    "After pretraining, I will fine-tune the model on a labeled dataset of hate speech and deploy the resulting model in the **Mahder AI** app.\n"

    "### 3.1 Data Collection  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to pretrain the Transformer network from scratch, we will use **self-supervised learning**, which requires a large corpus of unlabeled text. We will apply a **Masked Language Model (MLM)** to pre-train the model.  \n",

    "#### **Why Telegram Channels?**  \n",
    "Telegram is the most widely used platform for information storage in Ethiopia. For this reason, I have chosen **Telegram channels** as the primary data source. Most of the selected channels are news channels, ensuring a diverse and rich dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Collection Method**  \n",
    "To collect the data, I used the **Telethon Python library** and the **Telegram API** to scrape text from selected channels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Selected Telegram Channels**  \n",
    "The dataset has been collected from the following Telegram channels:  \n",
